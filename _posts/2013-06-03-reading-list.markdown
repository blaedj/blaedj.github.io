## Reading List ##

Over the course of my college career, I have been simultaneously fascinated by the concepts presented in class and disappointed by the lack of the practical lessons. This may or may not have been a bad thing, as it piqued my curiosity and led me to search elsewhere to supplement my college education.

I still owe a certain friend in college, now a college graduate working his way into infosec, [thesubtlety] http://www.thesubtlety.com, a huge favor. I still remember the day we were sitting in the library, 'studying', when he told me to command Google to do a barrel roll. It was amusing enough in its own right, but I was even more interested how he had stumbled upon this little gem. It was then I was introduced to [Hacker News] https://news.ycombinator.com/.

This opened a new world for me. Suddenly a treasure trove of links to random tech-y sites, describing the wonders of things with fantastic names, like django, ruby on rails, github, git, dependency injection, heroku, clojure, csrf....
Suddenly, the there was a raging river that I would try to draw a little stream of knowledge from to claim for my own. My bookmark folders ballooned out of control, and my attention may have waned some during class and study sessions, but finally I had a semi-curated 'library' to read from. And this was only the beginning, as through HN I found other sources, respected experts, and wonderfully informative blogs. I sometimes think that the most important thing I have gained from all this is a better big-picture view on my education.

Now, to get to the point of this post. Through this process of continual exploration and discovery, I found a few books kept popping up over and over in various, seemingly unrelated places. I started to keep a mental list of the books that came most recommended, ones that I *really* should read, when I got the time of course. I soon realized that a mental list was insufficient, and started several lists to keep track of these books. These text files, bookmark folders and amazon wish lists have now cumulated in this list, which will be updated as I check books off and add more, though I make no garuntee as to the regularity or quality of the updates.
